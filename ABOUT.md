# Tiny Crew: Revolutionizing Multi-Agent AI Systems

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multifaceted problems. Among these innovative solutions, Tiny Crew stands out as a game-changer, offering a unique approach to collaborative AI that promises to transform how businesses and researchers harness the power of multiple AI agents.

## The Genesis of Tiny Crew

While Tiny Crew draws inspiration from existing frameworks like CrewAI, it charts its own course with a revolutionary approach to agent assignment and task management. At its core, Tiny Crew leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) not just for task execution, but for the critical process of determining which agent is best suited for each specific task.

## Technical Foundation

Tiny Crew is implemented in TypeScript, providing strong typing and enhanced developer experience. Moreover, it's designed to run natively on Bun, a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, which offers significant performance improvements over traditional Node.js environments.

## Key Features that Set Tiny Crew Apart

1. **LLM-Driven Agent Selection**: Unlike traditional systems where tasks are assigned based on predefined rules or simple matching algorithms, Tiny Crew uses an LLM to analyze the task requirements and agent capabilities in real-time, making sophisticated decisions about task allocation.

2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: The system can adapt to new types of tasks or the introduction of new agents without requiring changes to the underlying assignment logic, thanks to the LLM's understanding of natural language descriptions of tasks and agent capabilities.

3. **Shared Knowledge Base**: Agents in Tiny Crew collaborate through a shared memory system, allowing for seamless information exchange and building upon each other's work.

4. **Tool Integration**: Agents can be equipped with various tools, extending their capabilities to interact with external systems, databases, or perform specific operations.

5. **Intelligent Summarization**: At the end of a mission, Tiny Crew uses its LLM to generate comprehensive summaries that tie together the work of all agents, providing insights and conclusions aligned with the overall goal.

## Code Examples

Let's look at some code examples to illustrate how Tiny Crew works in practice:

1. Creating a Crew and Adding Agents:

```typescript
import { Crew, Agent, OpenAI, FileWriteTool } from './tiny-crew';

const llm = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    baseURL: process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE_URL
});

const crew = new Crew('Develop a comprehensive market analysis report', llm);

const researchAgent = new Agent({
    name: 'MarketAnalyst',
    goal: 'Conduct in-depth market research and provide insightful analysis',
    model: 'gpt-4'
}, llm);

const writerAgent = new Agent({
    name: 'ReportWriter',
    goal: 'Synthesize research findings into well-structured reports',
    model: 'gpt-4'
}, llm, [new FileWriteTool()]);

crew.addAgent(researchAgent);
crew.addAgent(writerAgent);
```

2. Defining Tasks and Running the Crew Mission:

```typescript
const tasks = [
    'Research current market trends in the AI industry',
    'Analyze competitive landscape of leading AI companies',
    'Identify potential growth opportunities in the AI market',
    'Write a comprehensive market analysis report and save it as "ai_market_analysis.md"'
];

async function runMarketAnalysisMission() {
    for (const task of tasks) {
        const result = await crew.assignTask(task);
        console.log(`Task completed: ${task}`);
        console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
    }

    const missionSummary = await crew.achieveCrewGoal();
    console.log('Mission Summary:', missionSummary);
}

runMarketAnalysisMission();
```

3. Implementing a Custom Tool:

```typescript
import { Tool } from './tiny-crew';
import axios from 'axios';

class StockPriceTool implements Tool {
    name = 'StockPriceTool';
    description = 'Fetch current stock price for a given company symbol';

    async use({ symbol }: { symbol: string }): Promise<string> {
        try {
            const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/stock/${symbol}`);
            return `Current stock price of ${symbol}: $${response.data.price}`;
        } catch (error) {
            return `Error fetching stock price: ${error.message}`;
        }
    }
}

// Using the custom tool with an agent
const financialAgent = new Agent({
    name: 'FinancialAnalyst',
    goal: 'Analyze stock market trends and provide investment insights',
    model: 'gpt-4'
}, llm, [new StockPriceTool()]);

crew.addAgent(financialAgent);
```

These code examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of Tiny Crew, showcasing how easily you can set up a crew, add agents with specific goals and tools, and run complex missions.
